Ingredients

Crepes

16g unsalted butter melted

25g granulated sugar

2 eggs (about 55g each)

238g milk

82g cake flour

1 tbsp vanilla extract

Filling

220g heavy cream

20g granulated sugar

Fresh mango cubes



Notes: By cake flour, I mean low protein flour, which normally contains 7-9% protein (Mine is around 8%). Not self-rising flour.



Steps:

In a clean bowl, mix well melted butter, sugar, eggs, milk, cake flour and vanilla extract. Sift twice.
Grab a nonstick pan, no need to grease it, keep the heat low and warm the pan. Pour in a cup of batter, and gently move the pan around to let the batter spread evenly. Pour the extra batter back into the bowl. Keep the heat low and let cook for about 1 minute or until you can easily peel off the crepe from the edges with the help of a spatula. Repeat these steps until you use up all the batter. Let the crepes cool down on the cooling rack.
While letting the crepes cool down on the cooling rack, grab a clean bowl, bring together heavy cream and sugar, and use a hand mixer to beat until stiff peaks form. Transfer into a piping bag. Set in the fridge to keep it cool.
Assemble the crepe roll. Take three pieces of crepe and place them on the baking mat or pastry mat or parchment paper. Spread on a layer of whipped cream and a layer of fresh mango cubes. Fold in the edges and roll it up into a crepe roll. Let set in the fridge to cool for 30 minutes. Slice and serve.
